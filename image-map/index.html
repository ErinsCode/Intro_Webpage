        <h1>What's your favorite idea?  Mine is being creative</h1>

        <p>Below is a screenshot from the first episode of <em>Don't Hug Me I'm Scared</em>, a web series by British filmakers Becky Sloan and Joseph Pelling.  The series follows three characters: Red Guy, Yellow Guy, and Duck.  Throughout the series these three friends learn about different topics
            as if they are in a children's television show.  A main theme in the series is the power advertisers have in the creative aspects of television.  As these are our three main characters I've included links about each.
        </p>
        <p>There are some items in this scene that seem ordinary, but represent recurring themes in the series.  Throughout the series every day is 
            June 19th, until the end of the last episode, when the calendar finally changes to June 20th.  A picture in another room of the house is dated 
            June 19, 1955, a date when stock markets were at a record high.  The newspaper in this scene has an article about the stock markets as well.  You can see
            a close up image of the newspaper if you click on it.  If you click on the calendar it will take you to a video from the YouTube channel <em>The Film Theorists</em>
            that discusses the signifigance of this date in-depth.  In several episodes in the series some characters leave the house and the learning adventures, but try to contact their old friends through the
            phone.  At one point Red Guy tries calling his friends from a phone booth.  The phone number listed on the phone booth can be searched on Youtube to 
            find a hidden video.  If you click on the phone it will take you to that hidden video.</p>

            <p>Each episode has a teacher who interacts with the three main characters.  The first teacher is a notepad who teaches us about creativity.
                Clicking on this object will take you to a webpage with more information about the series, and an embedded video of this episode.  The second
                teacher is a clock, though, the clock does not look like this one.  You can see what he looks like by clicking on the clock here.
                Another teacher in this series focuses on healthy eating, and is portrayed as a steak.  Though there isn't a steak in this scene, there is the 
                fridge which contains all the food in the house.  Clicking this link will take you to a link with what the steak says about most foods.  </p>
