            <h3>Our Story</h3>
            <p>Pizza Pizzaria was started during the 16th Century in modern day Utah. Our first pizzas were sold out
                of a walk-in closet in Midvale. Once word got out about our pizzas we outgrew that closet
                and had to expand. First we moved to a chain of intertubes in the Jordan River, and then to an abandoned
                school bus, but both became problomatic with our fireclay ovens. We eventually settled in our current
                location
                in Herriman.
            </p>

            <p>Our pizza is made by an elite team of pizzateers from across the country. Our founder was born and raised
                in Utah
                and became obsessed with pizzas from a young age, eating pizza for all three meals since the age of six.
                The main
                chef at Pizza Pizzaria is a retired marine biologist who spent three decades on a submarine. Though the
                depths of the
                ocean were fascinating he decided he missed the fresh tomatoes and melted cheese of pizza, and decided
                to spend the rest
                of his days making this delicious food. The rest of our staff are made up of various Olympic athletes
                who left their
                respective sports as they aged. Some of these Olymplians were adversaries in their sports, but they all
                come together
                to make our pizza.
